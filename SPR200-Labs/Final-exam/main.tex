\ifanswer\else
This is basically free 2 marks for you, but you should still be careful to:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Read each line of the source files (Important: also the comments). If you don't, you lose 2 points.
    \item Fill in what are required in the first page. If you don't get everything right (e.g., have your course section number wrong, or your name is not in the right format, you filled your student number in your Seneca ID field, etc.), you lose 2 points.
    \item Complete all questions in \texttt{main.tex}.
    \item Compile \texttt{main.tex}. to a .pdf file, file name should be [Firstname].[Lastname].[SenecaID].pdf (e.g., ``John.Doe.jdoe2.pdf''). If you get any parts of the file name wrong, you lose 2 points.
    \item Restrain yourself from asking about what to submit -- it is all in the instructions. But if you really need to ask ``Is it the right file/style/file name/.. to submit?'' You will get a confirmation, but lose the marks of this question.

\section*{Part 2: Multiple Choice Questions [8 Points]}

\ifanswer\else
You may choose one of more options for each question. \\
You need to get all the options right to get marks.


\textbf{Example Question and Answer (you don't need to answer this question):}

When writing an initial email to your professors for discussing a formal academic matter, which \textbf{salutation} is considered to be impolite/annoying and might result in a bad impression?

\textbf{A} Hey Professor Huang \\
\textbf{B} Hi Teacher \\
\textbf{C} Hi Sir \\
\textbf{D} Hi Wei  \\
\textbf{E} No salutation, just start with the body of the email.

Answer: 
\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{
    B C E
}}

Explanation (You don't have to provide explanations in your submission):

\textbf{``Hi Teacher''} (Option B) Using ``Teacher'' as a name substitute shows a lack of effort to address the professor respectfully by name and position, and is generally considered inappropriate or annoying in professional academic communications.

\textbf{``Hi Sir''} (Option C) is inappropriate because ``Sir'' shows you don't even bother to address the professor's actual name or title, potentially signaling a lack of attention or courtesy.

\textbf{``No salutation''} (Option E) Obviously, it is not polite to not address your email recipient when starting the email thread.

On the other hand:

\textbf{``Hey Professor Huang''} (Option A), while informal (``Hey''), still correctly acknowledges the professor's title and last name, and might be acceptable in a slightly casual context.

\textbf{``Hi Wei''} (Option D), addressing by first name, might be appropriate depending on the context and whether your professor is a casual person, for example, in this SPR200 course, your professor is happy to be addressed by just his first name. However, not everyone else is.

\section*{Part 3: Practical Tasks [10 Points]}

\ifanswer\else

Your client provided you files of a pair of ECC cryptographic keys, but they did not tell you which ECC curve they are using. Now your client went camping in a place without cellphone signal or internet access (``I hope they suffer the life without internet,'' you think, ``they are so clumsy and careless and I hope they don't burn their campsite or left food outside to get eaten by bears!''). 

Anyways, now you are here to complete the following simple tasks in a few minutes (hopefully) with the keys your client provided, and then you can get off work early and enjoy your weekend with your loved ones too. Here is a list of the files your client left for you:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{private-key.pem}
    \item \texttt{public-key.pem}
    \item \texttt{client-message-to-sign.txt}
    \item \texttt{client-signature.txt}
\end{itemize}

\fi


\textbf{Task 1: Find out what ECC curve is used when the client generated the key pair. [2 points]}

\ifanswer\else

(Hint-1: In the lab, you use \texttt{openssl} to generate an ECC public key from a private key. How does the \texttt{openssl} command know which ECC curve to use to generate public key from private key? It must know, right? But how?)

(Hint-2: All details of openssl commands can be found in the manual, e.g., \texttt{\$man openssl ec})
\fi

The ECC curve used by the client is:

\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{
    \FillAnswer{secp521r1}
}}

How did you find out?

\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{
    \FillAnswer{openssl ec -in private-key.pem -noout -text}
}}

\ifanswer\else
\qnewpage
\fi

\textbf{Task 2: Print Out the Signature Clients Left. [2 points]} 

\ifanswer\else
So the client left you a signature: \texttt{client-signature.txt}. Now you need to print it out and send it to someone else along with the message \texttt{client-message-to-sign.txt}, so they can verify that it is indeed the client's signature on the message.

However, the signature is not readable when you try to open it, so you need to print it out in hex format. You wrote a python/shell program to do this and the output of your program by executing the following command is the hex format content of the signature file:

\fbox{\parbox{0.85\textwidth}{
\texttt{\$ python task2.py}
}}

or, 

\fbox{\parbox{0.85\textwidth}{
\texttt{\$ ./task2.sh}
}}

The client's signature in hex format is:

If you used a python program to solve it, please provide \texttt(task2.py) and submit it on GitHub in the same folder of your other files.

If you used a shell script to solve it, please provide \texttt(task2.sh) and submit it on GitHub in the same folder of your other files.

\fi

\ifanswer\else
\qnewpage
\fi

\textbf{Task 3: Verify the Signature. [2 points]}

\ifanswer\else
After you sent the signature and message file to someone else, they immediately responded to you: 

\fbox{\parbox{0.85\textwidth}{
Dear XXX,

I received your signature and message file. However, I cannot verify the signature because although I have the public key of the client, I don't know which hash algorithm the client used to generate the digest of the message.

Please let me know which hash algorithm the client used.

Best regards,

Someone Else

}}



\fi

The client's message digest algorithm used was:

\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{
    \FillAnswer{-sha3-512 }
}}

In one or a few sentences, explain briefly how you found out. If you wrote a program to solve it, please include how you used the program in the explanation:

\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{
    \FillAnswer{first I used this command: openssl dgst -list to list all possible digests, then I used the verify command for every digest replacing them each time until I got a Verified OK openssl dgst -sha3-512 -verify public-key.pem -signature client-signature.sig client-message-to-sign.txt. Essentially brute force}
}}

\ifanswer\else
If you used a python program to solve it, please provide \texttt(task3.py) and submit it on GitHub in the same folder of your other files.

If you used a shell script to solve it, please provide \texttt(task3.sh) and submit it on GitHub in the same folder of your other files.

\qnewpage
\fi



\textbf{Task 4: Python Program to Verify the Signature. [2 points]}

\ifanswer\else
Someone else also has many client messages and signatures to verify. Please write a python program to verify the signatures of the client. The program should run like this:

When the signature can be verified successfully:


\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{
    \$ task4.py client-message-21.txt client-signature-21.sig public-key.pem\\

    Signature verified successfully.
}}

When the signature cannot be verified successfully:

\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{
    \$ task4.py client-message-136.txt client-signature-136.sig public-key.pem\\

    Signature verification failed.
}}


Please provide \texttt(task4.py) and submit it on GitHub in the same folder of your other files.
\fi

Copy and paste the 9th non-empty line of your \texttt(task4.py) source code here:

\fbox{\parbox{\textwidth}{
    \FillAnswer{}
}}

\ifanswer\else
\qnewpage
\fi


\textbf{Task 5: Answer your client's question about post-quantum cryptography. [2 points]}


\ifanswer\else

Your client is a bit paranoid about the recent news about quantum computing and its potential impact on the security of the cryptographic systems they are using. They are concerned whether the signature scheme they used is still safe when quantum computers are powerful enough in the future. Please write an email to your client to explain:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What can quantum computers do?
    \item What can quantum computers do to the security of the cryptographic systems? 
    \item Is the ECC signature scheme still safe when quantum computers are powerful enough?
    \item If yes, why the current ECC signature scheme is still safe? If not, what can the client do if they want to improve the security of the signature scheme against future quantum attacks?
\end{enumerate}

\fi

Write the email to your client in the following box:

\fbox{\parbox{0.95\textwidth}{
Dear Valued Client,

Thank you for your inquiry regarding the security implications of quantum computing on our current cryptographic systems. I appreciate your proactive approach to understanding these important security considerations. \\

I would like to address your concerns with the following detailed explanation:

\FillAnswer{Quantum computers can do alote of things that classical computers cannot. They do not operate like classical computers that use regular bits (1 or 0) they use qubits (1 and 0), they are highly effective at specialised tasks\\

Quantum computers can affect the security of current cryptographic systems specifically RSA and those using eliptic curve cryptography. Algorithms like shor's algorithm reduce the security of current cryptographic systems to the point that they are no longer secure, for example it can turn an aes 2 to the power 128 key into 2 to the power 56 which is very breakable\\

No the ECC signature scheme is not safe when quantum computers are powerful enough as explained above\\

To better protect against quantum computer on cryptographic algorithms I highly reccomend using post quantum cryptographic algorithms like sphincs+ \\
}

I trust this information will assist you in making informed decisions regarding your cryptographic security strategy. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any clarification or have additional questions.

Best regards,

XXX

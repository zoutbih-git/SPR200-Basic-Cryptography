Jan 30 19:22:49.400 [notice] This version is not a stable Tor release. Expect more bugs than usual.
Jan 30 19:22:49.400 [notice] Configuration file "/usr/local/etc/tor/torrc" not present, using reasonable defaults.

Jan 30 19:22:49.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 0% (starting): Starting
Jan 30 19:22:49.000 [notice] Starting with guard context "default"
Jan 30 19:22:50.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 5% (conn): Connecting to a relay
Jan 30 19:22:51.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 10% (conn_done): Connected to a relay
Jan 30 19:22:52.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 14% (handshake): Handshaking with a relay
Jan 30 19:22:52.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 15% (handshake_done): Handshake with a relay done
Jan 30 19:22:52.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 20% (onehop_create): Establishing an encrypted directory connection
Jan 30 19:22:52.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 25% (requesting_status): Asking for networkstatus consensus
Jan 30 19:22:52.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 30% (loading_status): Loading networkstatus consensus
Jan 30 19:22:53.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We have no usable consensus.
Jan 30 19:22:53.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 40% (loading_keys): Loading authority key certs
Jan 30 19:22:54.000 [notice] The current consensus has no exit nodes. Tor can only build internal paths, such as paths to onion services.
Jan 30 19:22:54.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 45% (requesting_descriptors): Asking for relay descriptors
Jan 30 19:22:54.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/7893, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 0% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
Jan 30 19:22:54.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 50% (loading_descriptors): Loading relay descriptors
Jan 30 19:22:55.000 [notice] The current consensus contains exit nodes. Tor can build exit and internal paths.
Jan 30 19:22:56.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 56% (loading_descriptors): Loading relay descriptors
Jan 30 19:22:56.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 62% (loading_descriptors): Loading relay descriptors
Jan 30 19:22:56.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 70% (loading_descriptors): Loading relay descriptors
Jan 30 19:22:56.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 75% (enough_dirinfo): Loaded enough directory info to build circuits
Jan 30 19:22:56.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 90% (ap_handshake_done): Handshake finished with a relay to build circuits
Jan 30 19:22:56.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 95% (circuit_create): Establishing a Tor circuit
